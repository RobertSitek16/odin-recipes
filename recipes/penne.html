    <h3>Penne with chicken and pesto</h3>
    <p>This recipe idea started as just pasta and sauce. Because sometimes that's all you need to be satisfied. But I like to rummage through my pantry, fridge, and freezer to find leftover ingredients that can be added to whatever I'm cooking. That's how this recipe came about!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

		<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
		<li>1 cups heavy cream</li>
		<li>1/4 cup pesto</li>
		<li>3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>All necessary steps</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.</li>
		<li>Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
        <li>Heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute chicken and garlic until chicken is almost cooked.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat and stir in salt, pepper, cream, pesto and Parmesan cheese</li>
